# Getting Started with Drum Machine

This is my solution for Freecodecamp's Drum Machine challenge.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Sound Source

You may change the sound source for each drum pad at src/sound.js
